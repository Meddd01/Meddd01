Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Mohammed, a cybersecurity enthusiast, tech builder, and DJ based in Morocco.

I love creating tools, applications, and scripts that solve real problems, from networking utilities to full-stack apps. Whether itâ€™s in Python, JavaScript, or C++, I enjoy turning ideas into functional, efficient, and secure solutions.

Outside of code, youâ€™ll find me DJing, at hackathons, exploring OSINT techniques, or building side projects just for fun. I also enjoy sharing tech insights, startup ideas, and tips with the community.

**Fun Facts:**  
- Iâ€™m a tea person, but energy comes from passion (and maybe snacks).  
- Being a DJ is cool; mixing tracks feels just like coding â€” itâ€™s all about creativity and flow.  
- I have a knack for spotting vulnerabilities and turning them into learning opportunities.
